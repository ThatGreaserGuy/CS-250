A repository of my work for my Software Development Lifecycle class taught by Professor Konishi.

- - - - - FINAL PROJECT - - - - -
My final project consisted of an analysis of the Agile approach mindset with a Scrum focus as well
as a comparison against the traditional Waterfall methodology of software development (SDLC from
here on out).

The project consists of two files: a Word file familiar with Scrum reviews and retrospectives, and
a PowerPoint presentation that analyses and compares Agile with Waterfall while also referencing
pantomimed Scrum events that were instigated throughout the course.  These events were "imagined"
from the perspectives of each Scrum role: Developer/Tester, Product Owner, and Scrum Master.
